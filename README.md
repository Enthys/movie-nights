# Movie Nights üìΩÔ∏èüåâ
Movie nights is a simple project designed for me and my pals to track which movies we want to watch, what we've watched
and what we thought about the movies. The goal of the project is to make the project as simple is possible without
introducing any fancy tech into the stack.

## Stack
The stack of the project in to specific order is:
- Golang
- Goth
- Templ
- HTMX
- Postgres
- Bootstrap

## Features

### Authentication
Users can sign in only using Googles OAuth login. Logging in with username and password could be implemented in the
future if the need arises. The only required information for the application is the social network id(to link the 
account to an account in our platform), first name, last name and avatar(if exists).

### Groups
Users are able to create groups and join existing ones by applying to join and being approved by the creator of the 
group. A group is composed of a name and a description.

### Movies
Movies are added by their IMDB link. The contents of the film are scraped from its IMDB page and stored in the database.
The information for the movie consist of the title, description, genre, year and its IMDB rating.

### Movie propositions
Users can add movies to their groups. Once a movie is associated with a group, users can give a `Want to Watch` rating
for the added movie. 

## TODO:
- Want to watch rating
- Personal movie collection
